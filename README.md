# VLSI Labs
This repository contains detailed reports from my VLSI class projects, focusing on the design and simulation of digital circuits using Cadence Virtuoso. Each report covers the creation of logic gates, their assembly into complex circuits, and the execution of Design Rule Checking (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) tests. The reports also include background information on each circuit, functional output data, and images of both circuit designs and layouts. This collection showcases my practical skills in digital circuit design and testing in VLSI.

These labs were done in collaboration with Maxwell Blocker.
